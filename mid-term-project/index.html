            <h2>Process and Creative Choices</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> During the development of this game, I focused on creating an interactive narrative that allows players to make choices at every stage. Each choice leads to a different outcome, adding replay value to the game. The aim was to provide a storyline where Ben 10 transforms into different aliens to combat various enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Creative Choices:</strong> I chose to focus on a key feature of the Ben 10 series—alien transformations—by presenting players with a variety of aliens to choose from. This allowed the game to feel dynamic and gave each stage a unique challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the transitions between stages were smooth and logically made sense based on the player's choices. I also had to manage the complexity of handling images, so the right visuals would display based on the decisions made.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> The experience taught me the importance of structuring choices in a way that each decision feels impactful. It also emphasized the need for consistency in design and the importance of user feedback during game interaction.
